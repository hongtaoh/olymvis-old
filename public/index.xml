      <description>To me, the two most impressive websites based on blogdown are:
 Rob J Hyndman&amp;lsquo;s personal website. Live Free or Dichotomize by Lucy and Nick et al.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be more.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This sample post is mainly for blogdown users. If you do not use blogdown, you can skip the first section.
1. Markdown or R Markdown This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>

      <title>Changes in Female Participation over Time</title>
      <link>https://olymvis.netlify.app/vis1/</link>

      <description>var figure23 = vegaEmbed(&#39;#figure24&#39;, figure24);  As planned above, we started with a simple line graph displaying both male and female athletesâ€™ percentage against all athletes. The strength of this method is that it is simple and clear. It shows that the female percentage has been steadily growing in the past century at the Olympics. The drawback is that it does not generate a stark contrast between male and female as a stacked bar chart can do.</description>

      <title>Chnages in Female Particiation Across Continents</title>
      <link>https://olymvis.netlify.app/vis2/</link>

      <description>To visualize changes in female participation in each continent, we first used a simple line graph where we put all the continent together. The x-axis is time, and the y-axis is female participation. The legend shows the colors associated with the continents. See Figure 25.
 Figure 25: Line graph for female participation by continent The graph was very messy. As there were six continents and one global average, we could not distinguish between the seven categories very easily.</description>

      <title>Home-field Advantage, Medal Efficiency, and Sports Ranking</title>

      <description>Home-field Advantage As discussed above, we first tried scatter plot with jitter. The x-axis is the countries that have ever hosted the Olympics and y-axis denotes the percentage of a medals earned by a country against the total number of medals in that year. Blue dots represent data when the country were not the host and the orange ones for when it was the host. See Figure 31.

      <description>Female Participation in Summer Olympics Many attempts have already been made to visualize female participation in the Olympics. The most basic one (Bmallion, 2015) is using tables to display the information about countries with the highest and lowest percentages of female athletes, and to show female percentages across the 120 years of the Olympics. See Table 1.
  Table 1(a): Countries with the highest rate of female participation      Table 1(b): Female percentage in Olympic events     This method is simple and informative.</description>

      <description>The modern Olympic Games are the greatest sports mega-event in the world (Grix, 2013). It generates a massive number of audiences worldwide. The latest Rio 2016 Olympics, for example, attracted 3.5 billion viewers (Roxbourough, 2016), half of the world population. Apart from this mobilizing power, the Olympic Games have significant political (Giulianotii, 2015; Cottrell &amp;amp; Nelson, 2010; MacAloon, 1995), economic (Madden, 2002; Blake, 2005; Osada, Ojima, Kurachi, Miura, &amp;amp; Kawamoto, 2016), and socio-cultural (Malfas, Theodoraki, &amp;amp; Houlihan, 2004) impacts.</description>

      <title>Plans for Visualization</title>

      <description>Plans: Female Participation As discussed above, we will use a line graph, stacked bar chart, and area chart to show the overall trend of female participation in the Summer Olympics. For female participation in each individual continent, we will use KDE in a small multiple.
In a line graph, the x-axis will be time and the y-axis the percentage against the total number of participants. We will show both female and male athletes.</description>

      <description>Research Question Recap This paper answered four major questions:
 How does female participation at the Olympics, both overall and in each continent, change over time? Is there a home-field advantage at the Olympics? What is the medal efficiency for each country and region? Which sports have the highest number of participating athletes at the Olympics?  Major Findings Our visualizations demonstrated that:
  Both the total number of participating athletes and the percentage of female athletes in the Olympics has been increasing.</description>
